Installation:

Clone or download the repository. From the root folder run `npm install`. This will install all the necessary node modules for the theme. Once done, edit your `gulpfile.js` file and place your virtual host domain in the `browser-sync` section. 

Next, install <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/browsersync" rel="nofollow">browsersync</a> module and enable the `browser-sync` in the theme settings.

Finally, run `gulp` and watch the magic.
